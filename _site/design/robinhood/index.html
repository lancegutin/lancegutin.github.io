			Gold is the premium subscription product from Robinhood that offers customers better rates and advanced trading features for $5 a month.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of early 2024, Gold subscribers earned 5% APY on their uninvested cash, 3% match on retirement contributions, and a 1% boost on brokerage deposits.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a growth designer on the acquisition team, I partnered with a content designer, product manager, and engineering lead over the course of 3 months to design experiments to grow subscriptions to Robinhood Gold.
		</p>
		<h2>A heavy choice upfront</h2>
		<p>
			Historically, 15% of new customers subscribe to Gold during onboarding.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do so, customers must work through at least 38 steps — a process that includes account registration, identity verification, and account funding — before they are introduced to Gold and must decide if the program is worth the monthly fee.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once they opt-in, subscribers are then enrolled in a 30 day free trial.
		</p>
		<h2>Enrolling all new users by default</h2>
		<p>
			Our primary hypothesis centered on a belief that we could grow Gold subscriptions if it was easier to experience the program's benefits first before requiring payment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Specifically, if we defaulted all new users into a Gold free trial, then they would be more likely to pay for a subscription, ultimately increasing our baseline conversion metric above 15%.
		</p>
		<p>
			Testing this hypothesis required adjustments to the existing Gold experience in three main areas.
		</p>
		<h2>Repositioning Gold</h2>
		<p>
			First, we needed to introduce Gold to new customers during onboarding in a way that explained the offering concisely without comprising trust.
		</p>
		<div class="full-width-image">
			<img src="/assets/robinhood-onboarding-exploration.png" alt="Onboarding explorations">
		</div>
		<h4>I explored a variety of designs for onboarding that ranged from ad-like takeovers to educational checklists and timelines.</h4>
		<p>
			In the final design, Gold is introduced as a gift. This is paired with a timeline that is shown in progress as a means of reinforcing action. The program's premium rates are highlighted as well as the amount just deposited and the trial end date.
		</p>
		<img src="/assets/robinhood-trial-start.png" alt="Recommended onboarding screens">
		<h4 class="tight-caption">Gold is presented in onboarding across two screens. The timeline encourages customers to take advantage of the program's exclusive benefits before the end of their free trial.</h4>
		<h2>Highlighting Gold</h2>
		<p>
			After onboarding, customers are then given 30 days to try out Gold. Because they haven't committed to paying just yet, promoting Gold-only rates and features and messaging their limited time availability was a priority.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using previous research and data, I explored a variety of banner messages and design treatments in collaboration with my content design partner.
		</p>
		<img src="/assets/robinhood-diagram.png" alt="Diagram comparing banner messaging and design details">
		<h4>Explorations focused on banner messaging and design details.</h4>
		<p>
			Ultimately, a small set of banner variants was chosen based on context and user intent. Most banners paired the Gold logo with the most relevant benefit and the number of days left in the trial. For areas that already had strong Gold branding, a clock icon was used instead.
		</p>
		<img src="/assets/robinhood-mid-trial.png" alt="Mid trial banner designs">
		<h4 class="tight-caption">Analytics helped determine where Gold banners were most likely to drive conversion.</h4>
		<h2>Making the choice a no-brainer</h2>
		<p>
			The experiment hinged on crafting a compelling end of trial conversion moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			I focused on quantifying the value accrued from Gold's premium rates as well as comparing a world with Gold against a world without Gold.
		</p>
		<div class="full-width-image">
			<img src="/assets/robinhood-end-of-trial-exploration.png" alt="End of trial explorations">
		</div>
		<h4>For the end of trial takeover, I pursued a hero area that was both clear and persuasive.</h4>
		<p>
			The strongest design presented a single accrued amount alongside a stylized chart reinforcing Gold's superior earnings potential.
		</p>
		<p>
			I worked with an illustrator to elevate the concept with an isometric graphic.
		</p>
		<img src="/assets/robinhood-end-trial.png" alt="End of trial takeover screens">
		<h4 class="tight-caption">Users that accumulate more than the $5 subscription fee are shown an infographic that quantifies the amount earned. All other users get a more generic educational screen.</h4>
		<h2>Accelerated growth</h2>
		<p>
			This effort to give all new customers Gold by default launched as part of a series of experiments to grow Gold subscriptions.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the first quarter of 2024, 20% of new Robinhood customers subscribed to Gold, representing a 5% increase from the previous quarter and a clear improvement on our primary metric.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, during the same time frame, Robinhood added 240,000 new Gold subscribers, its fastest growth in 3 years.
